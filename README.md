Aspire Accelerator: Fast-Track to Cloud-Native Development
==========================================================

A great introduction to [Aspire](https://aspire.dev/) including references to:

- databases
- running AI models
- deployment to Kubernetes
- and much more

We're [Rob Richardson](https://robrich.org/) and [Barry Stahl](https://cognitiveinheritance.com/) and we're exited to share this with you.  Though we'll demo each of these pieces, you can also follow along or recreate these demos from each of the folders in this repo.
